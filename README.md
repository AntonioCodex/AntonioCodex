## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**AntonioCodex/AntonioCodex** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

ğŸ”­ I'm currently working on learning Git and GitHub to effectively manage my web application development projects.
ğŸŒ± Currently, I'm learning about JAVA, HTML, CSS, and frameworks like Spring Framework and Spring Boot to enhance my skills as a web application developer.
ğŸ‘¯ I'm looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to web development to learn and contribute to the community.
ğŸ¤” I'm looking for help with Git and GitHub workflow, especially in areas like branching, merging, and conflict resolution.
ğŸ’¬ You can ask me about basic web development concepts, tools like VS Code, or how to get started with Git and GitHub.
ğŸ“« You can reach me via email at [x] or find me on [AntonioCodex].
âš¡ Fun fact! When I'm not coding, I'm running or taking photos in the mountains.
